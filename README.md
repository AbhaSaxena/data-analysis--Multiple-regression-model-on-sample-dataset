# data-analysis--Multiple-regression-model-on-sample-dataset
This is a Data Science project in R. In this project, I have created a Multiple Regression model with a sample dataset present in R library.

This dataset "mtcars" gives a comparison between different car models in terms of mileage per gallon (mpg), cylinder displacement("disp"), horse power("hp"), weight of the car("wt") and some more parameters.

The goal of the model is to establish the relationship between "mpg" as a response variable with "disp","hp" and "wt" as predictor variables.
